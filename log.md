### Day 7: January 13, 2017

**Today's Topic:** Wordpress

**Today's Progress:** Working with a child theme to add a business phone number above social media links. When the phone number was initially added it would extend past the border if the window was resized too small. Now it stays within the border, but the social media icons go below the number one at a time (instead of as a block). Will definitely revisit.
