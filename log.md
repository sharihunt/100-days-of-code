**Today's Topic:** CSS

**Today's Progress:** Udemy - The Complete Webdeveloper Course 2.0 was purchased primarily for the other lessons (i.e. Javascript, APIs, MySQL, PHP etc.). Originally, I was going to watch some of the HTML/CSS videos to review and see the teaching style. After starting the course I also decided to try Sublime. Now I'm using the HTML/CSS lessons to get use to the new editor.

### Day 7: January 13, 2017

**Today's Topic:** Wordpress

**Today's Progress:** Working with a child theme to add a business phone number above social media links. When the phone number was initially added it would extend past the border if the window was resized too small. Now it stays within the border, but the social media icons go below the number one at a time (instead of as a block). Will definitely revisit.
